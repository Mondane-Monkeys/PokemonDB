Implement frontend stuff
 - Display all fields
    - set-select (check boxes?)
 - handle sub-queries
    - Structure flags correctly
 - Create view models
    - graphs

Test stuff
 - Query with 1 parameter with multiple orders
 - Wildcard strings (%%) how to implement?


Server changes
 - Print correct hostname to connect to

Important note from importing:
	- need to review moves and move effects table
		- also find status effect data
	- missing description for abilities
	- find pokemon go data
	- complete the items table
		- information from this table is in different locations  need to be stiched together
	- look into the (disliked+favourite)_flavor column and what it means
	- Card prices missing
	- Energy contents is empty (removable?)
	- pkmn_card_evolutions contents is empty (removable?)
   - Trainer pokemon has a lot more data: Need to change trainer_teams data

changes:
	- changes scema for catch_location tables to include the level
	- should we also include the game version?? (We have the data)

ERRORS encountered:
-for pokemon_moves use pokemon_moves_without_version.csv to insert data
	encountered Runtime error near line 223785: UNIQUE constraint failed: pokemon_moves.pokemon_id, pokemon_moves.move_id (19)

- we need to fix foreign key constraint with locations
- need to fix foreign key constraint for catch_locations
